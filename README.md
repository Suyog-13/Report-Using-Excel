## 🧪 Data Cleaning Steps
To ensure data integrity, the following steps were taken:
1.  **Standardized Gender Column:** Fixed inconsistencies (e.g., converting "W" to "Women" and "M" to "Men").
2.  **Age Grouping:** Created a new `Age Group` column using the `IF` function to categorize customers into *Teenager, Adult, and Senior*.
3.  **Date Formatting:** Extracted the `Month` from the order date to enable monthly trend analysis.
4.  **Quantity Check:** Verified and cleaned the `Qty` column to ensure no zero or negative values influenced the revenue.
